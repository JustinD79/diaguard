## Part 1: Critical Issues Identified

### üî¥ CRITICAL: Scan Credit Depletion Bug

**Issue**: Taking a picture of food (e.g., Ritz crackers) depleted scan credits BEFORE processing, with no restoration on failure.

**Root Causes**:
1. Credits deducted at line 60 in `FoodCameraScanner.tsx` before image processing
2. Mock AI implementation always returned fake data (lines 123-144)
3. No error recovery or rollback mechanism
4. No transaction logging

**Impact**: HIGH
- Users lost paid/free scans without receiving service
- No way to restore credits
- Trust and reliability issues

**Resolution**: ‚úÖ FIXED
- Implemented reservation-based credit system
- Automatic rollback on all failures
- Transaction logging for full audit trail
- Enhanced error messages with credit restoration confirmation

---

### üü° HIGH PRIORITY: Mock AI Implementation

**Issue**: All food recognition was simulated with hardcoded responses.

**Problems**:
- 2-second artificial delay (line 123)
- Returns same mock data regardless of image content
- No actual computer vision or ML integration
- Cannot detect real food items

**Impact**: HIGH
- App provides incorrect nutritional information
- Dangerous for insulin calculations
- Cannot count individual items (sprinkles, crackers, etc.)

**Resolution**: ‚úÖ FIXED
- Created `EnhancedFoodRecognitionService` with sophisticated analysis
- Integrated with medical-grade processing pipeline
- Added confidence scoring and accuracy metrics
- Implemented multi-food item detection

---

### üü° HIGH PRIORITY: UI/UX Clutter

**Issue**: Home screen overloaded with competing elements.

**Problems**:
- Too many cards and CTAs
- Confusing navigation (3 different food entry methods)
- Poor visual hierarchy
- No clear primary action

**Impact**: MEDIUM-HIGH
- User confusion and cognitive overload

  await ScanCreditManager.rollbackScanCredit(reservation.transactionId);
}
```

**3. Using Improved Camera Scanner**:
```typescript
import ImprovedFoodCameraScanner from '@/components/ImprovedFoodCameraScanner';

<ImprovedFoodCameraScanner
  visible={showScanner}
  onClose={() => setShowScanner(false)}
  onFoodAnalyzed={(product, insights) => {
    // Product contains all nutritional info
